# Automated Credit Card Approval Predictor 💳
Stop letting manual application review drain time and money.

Commercial banks receive countless credit card applications, and the process of manually sifting through them is notoriously slow, error-prone, and inefficient. This project cuts through the noise by leveraging the power of Machine Learning to automate the entire decision-making process, building a robust and fast Credit Card Approval Predictor.

Using the public Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, we develop a high-performance classification model that predicts if an individual’s application will be accepted, just like the real banks do.
